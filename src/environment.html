							<p>To help raise awareness of the environmental problem posed by the huge quantities of solid plastic waste on the seabed, Aquafil is supported by the foundation "The Healthy Seas, a Journey from Waste to Wear" co-founded in 2013. One of the foundation’s aims is to prevent plastics from ending up in the seas and rivers, raising awareness and encouraging the public, operators and authorities to play an active part in this process.</p>
							<p>Thanks to the contribution of groups of volunteer divers, the organisation works to recover ghost nets trapped in wrecks at sea or lying on the seabed. After bringing them back to the ports, it identifies, sorts and cleans them. Some of the nets, where suitable and made of Nylon 6, are used by Aquafil and reprocessed in its chemical plant. Although the amount recovered is very small compared to the amount used by Aquafil on a daily basis, nonetheless it is a contribution to reducing plastic in the seas.</p>
							<p>The project also includes school encounters aimed at raising awareness of plastic pollution in our oceans. The project, which was initially launched on the coasts of Belgium and the Netherlands in the North Sea, has now been extended to Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom.</p>

							<p>Effective energy management has implications for both environmental and economic sustainability. In this regard, the Group has made two specific commitments, as stated in the Group’s Sustainability Plan:</p>
							<p>1) To invest in energy from renewable sources, in order to preserve exhaustible resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions;</p>
							<p>2) To reduce the impacts of production processes and increase their efficiency. In 2020, 69% of the total electrical and thermal energy used by the Group came from certified renewable sources, such as hydroelectric, wind, photovoltaic and biomass. In particular, 95% of electricity was obtained from renewable sources. The Group also invests in self-generated power systems: the Aquafil plants have installed photovoltaic panels in the United States and in Italy, in Slovenia and Croatia, which, while only providing a small percentage of the total energy requirements, can meet the energy needs of certain facilities such as administrative offices. Table 18 shows the total amount of energy managed and consumed by the Group from 2016 to 2020. Consumption is expressed in absolute terms and divided by energy carrier and destination (used internally or sold). Furthermore, the total energy consumption is reported in relation to the margin (expressed as EBITDA) in order to show the trend over the years.</p>

In plants with an ISO 14001-certified Environmental Management System, this issue is addressed to ensure ongoing compliance with any national regulations that protect water resources. The same level of attention and commitment to the correct and efficient management of water consumption is also in place in non certified plants, because the Group is aware of the importance of this resource. Approximately 87% of the volume of water withdrawn comes from groundwater (wells), with the remainder from aqueduct and surface water (rivers). To give an overview of performance in terms of water withdrawal, Figure 14 shows performance over the period 2016 - 2020, broken down by type (groundwater, third-party water resources and surface water) measured in megalitres.</p>

Table 20 shows the volume of water withdrawal broken down by source, plant and water stress area for the year 2020; it can be seen that withdrawals occur on average in areas of medium to low water stress.</p>
